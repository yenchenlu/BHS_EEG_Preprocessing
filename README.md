# BHS_EEG_Preprocessing
## BrainHack School 2023 Project 

This project aims to do a pre-processing of an open dataset regarding an auditory oddball effect. We selected the dataset from OpenNeuro which contain 13 participants. Pure tones with respectively 500 Hz and 1000 Hz, as well as a 1000 Hz white noise distractors, are presented to the participants to examine their neural responses in the oddball task.

We will mainly focus on the pre-processing of the open dataset using MNE-Python package. The pre-processing will include handling bad channels, filtering, artifact detection, and repairing artifact with ICA. We aim to show the pipeline of data pre-processing with data visualization in a Jupyter notebook.
